Welcome to [[notenote.link::https://github.com/Maxence-L/notenote.link]], a fork of [[Simply Jekyll::https://github.com/raghuveerdotnet/simply-jekyll]]!

Currently a university student, I've spent the last 3 years burying myself into many facets of mathematics, computer science, and logic.

This site is meant to be an archive of tidbits of the arcane knowledge I've learned doing coursework and research, and I hope will become a standalone archive apomb with dubiously useful, but still neat content on C++, math, PL and logic. 

My current work is primarily with epistemic logic, algebra, and number theory, though currently I have a fascination with homotopy type theory. Stay tuned for future updates, including but not limited to: new posts, code snippets, and interesting additions to the site.
