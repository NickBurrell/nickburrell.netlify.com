Privacy is something that I, like many who may be reading this take seriously. So you may be asking yourself, "Nick, why do you need cookies for a technical blog?" The answer is simple: storing preferences for page styles. 

If you want a more high-contrast color scheme, that option will be available to you soon. If you prefer the current theme, that is also your choice. I intend down the line to integrate a dark theme into the entire site, and potentially integrate with system settings to make the site as aesthetically pleasing as possible. I can safely say I have no intention of collecting or selling data, as I am opposed to that practice myself. Rest assured, if you enable cookies, the *only* information that will be tracked will be viewing and theme preferences.
